## 1. Bulk Materials Catalog

### 1.1 Overview
All bulk materials are priced in two units:
- **CFT (Cubic Feet)**: Per cubic foot pricing
- **Tonnage**: Per ton pricing

### 1.2 Aggregate Materials

| Material Type | CFT Price | Tonnage Price | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 6mm Aggregate | ₹58/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Standard pricing |
| 12mm Aggregate | ₹50/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Standard pricing |
| 20mm Aggregate | ₹50/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Standard pricing |
| 30mm Aggregate | ₹55/cft | ₹1,050/ton | Premium pricing |
| 40mm Aggregate | ₹55/cft | ₹1,050/ton | Premium pricing |

**Pricing Analysis:**
- 6mm aggregate commands highest CFT price at ₹58/cft
- 12mm and 20mm are most cost-effective at ₹50/cft
- Larger aggregates (30mm, 40mm) have premium pricing structure

### 1.3 Sand Materials

| Material Type | CFT Price | Tonnage Price |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| M Sand | ₹60/cft | ₹1,200/ton |
| P Sand | ₹70/cft | ₹1,300/ton |

**Key Observations:**
- P Sand is premium grade (₹10/cft premium over M Sand)
- Higher tonnage pricing reflects quality difference

### 1.4 Specialty Materials

| Material Type | CFT Price | Tonnage Price | Special Notes |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| Wet Mix (WMM) | ₹50/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Ready-mix application |
| Road Granulated Subbase (GSB) | ₹50/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Road construction |
| Filling Granulated Subbase (Filling GSB) | - | - | Category listing only |
| Dust | ₹50/cft | ₹1,000/ton | Fine aggregate |
| Flyash | ₹1.2/kg | ₹1,200/ton | Previously ₹140/kg (struck through) |
| Hill Earth | ₹30/cft | ₹800/ton | Most economical option |

**Special Notes:**
- Flyash pricing shows significant revision (from ₹140/kg to ₹1.2/kg)
- Hill Earth is most cost-effective material
- Filling GSB requires separate pricing specification
